## 📝 STEP 1: Create Repository on GitHub

**Go to:** https://github.com/new

**Fill in exactly:**
```
Repository name: portfolio
Description: Professional ML Engineer Portfolio - Responsive, Animated, Mobile-Optimized
Public: ✅ (selected)
Add README: ❌ (unchecked)

**Click:** "Create repository"

## 📤 STEP 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, **COPY AND PASTE** these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project
cd C:\Users\HP\Downloads\portofolio3-main\portofolio3-main\portofolio3

# Check status
git status

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### **When it asks for credentials:**

**Option A - Use Credential Manager (Easiest):**
If you've used GitHub before on this computer, it might use saved credentials automatically.

**Option B - Use Personal Access Token:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: `Portfolio Push`
4. Select: ✅ **repo** (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (starts with `ghp_`)
7. When PowerShell asks:
   - Username: `Hasnain006-nain`
   - Password: **Paste your token**

## 🎯 STEP 3: Verify on GitHub
